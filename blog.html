                We have been running for an hour, there are many cuts all along my hand and I have broken one of my heels. I can't hear anything except my heart pounding in my ear. So I decreased my pace to calm my heart and to see if we are being followed anymore. I signaled for everyone to stop.
                " I don't think we are being followed anymore," I said. 
                " I guess you are right," Jim said. There was a long cut across his chest and his shirt was soaked
                 " Oh my God! Is that blood? Are you hurt?" I asked. 
                "Nah, it's just a scratch, it's not even...."  But his sentence was drowned by a gunshot
                
           <p> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
                What I wouldn't have given for all of this to be a terrible nightmare. 
                but, no one can change the fact that it's my life now.
